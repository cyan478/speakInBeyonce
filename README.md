#Speak in Beyoncé

> Flawless Hacks 2017 (April 22)

By Celine Yan, Laura Goon, Nancy Cao

### Purpose

Speak in Beyoncé is a web application that allows users to express themselves through Queen Bee herself in song lyrics and GIFs. When the user inputs a line describing how they are feeling, the web app generates a corresponding lyric from one of Beyoncé's songs and GIFs of Beyoncé. Speak in Beyoncé was a fun project we came up with for Flawless Hacks 2017, deemed as "The world’s only Beyonce-themed hackathon." 

### Technicalities

We utilized the IBM Watson API and the GIPHY API. IBM Watson was used to determine both the emotion of user input and scan through Beyoncé's songs lyric by lyric to determine the lyric that best corresponded to user input. In the 12-hour hackathon, we stored in three of Beyoncé's song lyrics locally, since it would take too long for IBM Watson to analyze all of her songs. The GIPHY API took in the emotion word generated by IBM Watson and keywords from the user input, coupled with the keywork Beyoncé, and searched for GIFs in the GIPHY database.
